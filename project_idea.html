    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      I am unsure about the scope the project can take within the limits of this course, so I will outline my idea in levels.
      The overall goal is to create a system inspired by <em>Skylanders</em> or <em>Nintendo’s Amiibos</em>, but designed for <strong>Dungeons & Dragons (DnD)</strong> characters.
    </p>

    <h2>Level 1</h2>
    <p>
      Similar to Skylanders or Amiibos, I want to create figures of DnD characters that store their character’s information within their base.
      Then, I would like to create an external box-like device, with a scanner on top, which continuously reads and writes onto the character, to display the character sheet.
    </p>

    <h2>Level 2</h2>
    <p>
      I would like additional inputs, such as a calculator that contains numbers from 0 to 9, a clear and remove key, and a plus and minus key.
      This would allow you to write a number to add or remove from your character's health.
    </p>

    <h2>Level 3</h2>
    <p>
      Additionally, I would like to add buttons for each DnD die, so that you can easily roll, keeping the last roll displayed on screen.
      These would be buttons for a <strong>d4</strong>, <strong>d6</strong>, <strong>d8</strong>, <strong>d10</strong>, <strong>d12</strong>, <strong>d20</strong>, and <strong>d100</strong>, ordered by importance (so the d20 would be first).
    </p>
    <p>
      An alternative design would be a dial that has different intervals mapped to the different dice. 
      Then, if possible, I would like to light up the dice display of the currently selected die.
    </p>

    <h2>Level 4</h2>
    <p>
      Next, above the display showing initiative and modifiers, I want to add a slider to select what modifier you want to roll for. 
      Next to the display, on the left, I would include a switch to toggle between normal rolls and saving throws.
    </p>

    <h2>Level 5</h2>
    <p>
      (To be determined) — At this stage, I would refine or expand on the interaction design based on what’s feasible within the course.
      Possible extensions could include LED feedback, modular character stands, or integration with a companion web app for digital tracking.
