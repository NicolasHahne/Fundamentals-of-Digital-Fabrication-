    <h2>Task 1</h2>
    <p>Created GitHub and web pages.</p>
    <h2>Task 2 (WIP)</h2>
    <p><strong>Current State</strong></p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://github.com/NicolasHahne/Fundamentals-of-Digital-Fabrication-/blob/main/task%202/Project%20Concept.f3d">WIP
        Project Concept</a>
    </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, I didn't get to finish this project just yet.<br>
      I tried out a bunch of design ideas and iterated through them, leaving me with a bunch of ideas that I couldn't
      finish implementing in time.</p>
    <p>In the linked file, you can see one of three shelf segments, with a pot to hold the character, a screen to
      display information, and two books with writing that will serve as buttons to roll for those specific actions.</p>
    <p><strong>End Goal</strong></p>
    <p>If I were able to finish it, the shelf would be assembled in the shape of the top half of a hexagon.<br>
      The character would be placed at the same spot where the pot is now, with a screen above showing the character's
      name, health, size, weight, and other basic stats.<br>
      The right side of the center shelf would concern itself with more character information and traits, like movement,
      racial traits, background features, and proficiencies.<br>
      The base plate at the front would contain a calculator to add or subtract health points, as well as some other
      navigational features.<br>
      Then, in the right shelf, you'd find the “books” I already made for the ability scores and skill rolls, as well as
      another book with its cover facing the front, containing a screen with the actions like attack, spellcasting, and
      other common rolls.<br>
      Above the books, if possible, you'd find 8-balls or a basic screen to display the result of the rolls.<br>
      The left shelf would be used for the inventory and a display for the armor class on top.<br>
      On the back of the shelf, there would be another screen to display relevant information to other players (like
      name, health, and effects).<br>
      Finally, at the top of the shelf, there would be a flat screen showing the current turn order in combat.
    </p>
    <p><strong>How I achieved the current state</strong></p>
    <p>This will only contain what you can see in the current state, not what I did for the prior iterations.</p>
    <p>Excuse any incorrect terminology. I am more familiar with Blender and how things are called there.<br>
      I also have my application in German, so I don't know the proper English terms.</p>
    <p>I started off by creating a sketch for the base plate and extruding it.<br>
      Then, I created a sketch representing half the intersection of a pin to hold the base plate in place, rotated it
      into a mesh, positioned it at a corner of the base plate, and duplicated it with a rectangular displacement,
      keeping the center spots empty.<br>
      After that, I created the pot using a similar method and placed it at the back left-hand corner of the base
      plate.<br>
      Then I went back and created the rest of the shelf with another sketch that I then extruded twice — first to
      create the back, then to create the frame. Then I rounded the edges.<br>
      After that, I created the screen in the shelf by extruding the face into a separate component, insetting the face
      by 5 millimeters, and pushing the face forward to create the screen.<br>
      Then, I created the books by creating a cube, beveling the side edges facing toward the front, and insetting
      (hollowing) the cube by a few millimeters.<br>
      Next, I created another, slightly smaller cube and placed it inside, creating the book look.<br>
      Then, using the rectangular duplication tool, I copied the book over.<br>
      Next, I created a cube, rounded its corners, placed a cylinder with rounded edges inside, and joined them to carve
      out a bit in the middle, where I placed another cylinder with rounded edges to create a switch.<br>
      Finally, with another sketch, I created the text seen on the side of the books, which I extruded. These words will
      function as buttons that roll for that check when pressed.</p>


    <h2>Task 3 - 3D Printing</h2>

    <p>
      For this assignment, we had to create and print a model that would be difficult to create with subtractive methods
      like milling but more easily created with additive methods like 3D printing.
    </p>

    <h3>Model Idea</h3>
    <p>
      For this assignment, I thought that printing a figurine of my current DnD character would be a good idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only because I would have needed to print it at some point anyway, as the character is needed for my final
      project, but also because I believe a small, detailed figurine would be difficult to create subtractively due to
      the many complex organic shapes that can also intertwine and overlap.
    </p>

    <h3>Model Creation</h3>
    <p><img src="task 3/BlenderRender.png"><br>
      I created my model in Blender.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, I started out by creating a primitive shape, either a sphere or a cube, which I then sculpted into the head
      of my character.<br>
      I used mirrored sculpting along the X-axis; however, it did not always work perfectly, like for the hollowed-out
      eyes and eye ridges, and especially the ears.<br>
      That wasn't really a problem, however, as no organism would ever truly be perfectly symmetrical.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I just said, I hollowed out the eye sockets. I filled in the eyes by creating a sphere, moving it into place,
      and mirroring it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, I created a separate object for the tusks in the form of a cylinder, which I also scaled, moved into
      place, and mirrored.
      Then, I disabled all mirroring, as only one of the tusks of my character is still intact.<br>
      I then sculpted the full tusk into shape.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, I created a cube, added and applied a subdivision surface modifier, and used proportional editing to form it
      into a leg shape, adding loop cuts around it to give it form.
    </p>

    <p>
      I tried sculpting the hoof nails; however, they did not turn out the way I wanted, so I moved on and later created
      them with small subdivided round cubes, proportionally edited into shape, then duplicated and placed where I
      wanted them.
    </p>

    <p>
      After that, I created a sphere, proportionally editing it into the rough shape of a chubby elephant body
      (torso).<br>
      I then sculpted some more details around the chest and back, generally also defining the shape a little more.
    </p>

    <p>
      With the head, body, and legs completed, I started giving my character a slightly angled pose, positioning the
      individual pieces as I saw fit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, I created my character’s hammer by creating a cube and scaling it to be wider. I then beveled the edges.<br>
      To create the hilt, I created a cylinder, made it thin and tall, gave it a bunch of loop cuts, and beveled the
      edges, hiding the lower end within the hammer, eyeballing the center position.
    </p>

    <p>
      To estimate the right position, I created more cylinders, gave them loop cuts, and formed them a bit into pose
      using proportional editing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Having positioned everything, I then added the base plate and positioned it so that the character comfortably sat
      on top of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      With all of these elements done, it was time to dress my character, so I created another cylinder, removed its top
      and bottom, and extruded it inwards.<br>
      Switching from edit to sculpt mode, I used the pull brush to pull the dress around the body's contour and to add
      folds in the fabric.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, I created a plane, subdividing it a bunch and adding cloth simulation physics to it.<br>
      I then added physics collisions to the body, legs, ground, and dress, simulating how the cloth would fall onto the
      body.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I liked the size and look of the robe, I baked the simulation.<br>
      However, I felt like one layer of robe didn’t cut it, so I added another subdivided cloth physics plane to the
      scene, and a collider to the original cloth, simulating how it would fall on top of the other one.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, I wanted to add a belt around where the dress and the body meet, so I created a curve, shaped it the way I
      needed, and converted it to a mesh so I could apply geometry nodes.<br>
      Using geometry nodes, I hooked it into a mesh-to-curve, resampled the curve to be more detailed, and then linked
      it into a curve-to-mesh node.<br>
      There, I set the profile curve to a curve circle and hooked up the radius to a noise texture, mapping its values
      to the radii I wanted, and increased the scale of the noise to make it look more rope-like.
    </p>

    <p>
      To simulate the robe shaping under the belt's pressure, I added physics collisions to it as well and animated it,
      making it large at the start, slowly scaling down to normal size.<br>
      That way, the cloth would have time to fall down on the body normally and then be tightened around the hips when
      the belt moved into it.<br>
      Therefore, I rebaked the simulations.
    </p>

    </video>

    <p>
      To wrap up on the belt, using similar methods, I created another curve, turning it into a knot shape with threads
      hanging down, following the same curve-to-mesh procedure as before, with the values adjusted.
    </p>

    <p>
      Next, for the hand that's wrapped around the hammer’s hilt, I created a sphere, sculpting it into shape.<br>
      Same for the other hand, but because of its different position, I used a short, long cube as a base instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      I then adjusted the shape of the arms to fit better, sculpting them into the wide arms of the robe, with gravity
      pulling down the sleeves and adding folds.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, I created a necklace ring using the same curve-to-mesh method and sculpted another cylinder into the
      broken-off tusk my character now displays around their neck.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="task 3/LoxodonFigurine.stl">The final models .stl file.</a></p>
    <p><strong>The Print</strong></p>
    <p style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;"><img
        src="task 3/DravokarFigurineFront.jpg"><img src="task 3/DravokarFigurineBack.jpg"></p>
    <p>
      With my first print complete, I’m quite happy with the overall result. The main features came out nicely, and many
      fine details are still clearly visible.<br>
      The sleeve and facial features printed crystal clear, and even smaller elements like the tusks, trunk, and chain
      around the neck are well-defined.<br>
      The battle hammer, likely thanks to its simple shapes, also retained its details very well.<br>
      The legs and hooves are also clearly visible and turned out great.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some finer details, however — such as the belt laces, the insides of the ears, the robe tips, and the small
      ripples
      in the fabric—didn’t survive the print as well.<br>
      I realized that my model was simply too small to reproduce those very delicate elements reliably.<br>
      Many of these features were also unsupported or suspended in midair, which made them more prone to failure during
      printing.<br>
      If I had used more of the available baseplate area and scaled the model up by around 1.5× to 2×, those details
      might have printed more successfully.<br>
      A slightly larger size would also have reduced the issue of trying to remove thin or fragile parts from the
      supporting structures.
    </p>

    <p>Despite these small losses in quality during the print, I don't mind all too much for this figurine, as the
      torn-up robes and ears actually fit the character represented quite nicely - as an undead being.</p>

    <p>
      My main takeaway from this print is to scale up future figurines and other small, detailed models to ensure better
      durability and sharper results. Overall, I’m pleased with this first attempt and look forward to improving further
      with these insights in mind.
